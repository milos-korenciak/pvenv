P(ortable) V(irtual)env
==================

This is Portable conda virtualenv. Just 1. download, 2. unarchive, 3. activate and 4. GO!

* = Works purely in userspace in the dir with just RW access. (No extra admin rights needed.) =
* = Isolated into its directory only. (In install time, not runtime.) =
* = Mutiplatform. (Build on the shoulder of the TITANS - anaconda.com.) =
* = Portable - you can just copy it to next place OR user. * (Until installed non-portable software.) =

/* Non-portable libraries hardcode the PATH where they are. Read more here.
